## 🍽️ The Existential Lunch Crisis

Lunch is not a meal.  
Lunch is a **metaphysical event**.

Every day at noon, the clock strikes twelve, and so begins humanity’s oldest tragedy:  
**Decision.**

Not the grand, cinematic decisions of life or death, love or war.  
No — the quiet horror of indecision between noodles and rice.

We are Sisyphus, cursed not to push a boulder, but to scroll endless food delivery apps.  
We are Hamlet, except the question is not "to be or not to be,"  
but “sushi or salad?”

## 🔄 Choice is an Illusion

When you say “anything is fine,”  
you are lying to yourself and to the universe.

You do not want “anything.”  
You want to be surprised by a decision you didn’t have to make.  
You want chicken, but only if someone else says it first.

This project does not answer the question.  
It **becomes** the question.  
It dances around it, laughs in its face, and whispers:  
“You were never hungry — you were empty.”

## 🥢 In Summary

Lunch is chaos.  
This repo is a shrine to that chaos.  
Cloning it will not save you.  
Reading this will not feed you.  
But maybe, just maybe, you'll feel seen.
