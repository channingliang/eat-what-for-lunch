# eat-what-for-lunch

> "What’s for lunch?" – A question that has destroyed more friendships than Monopoly ever could.

## 🤔 What is this?

**eat-what-for-lunch** is our group's noble, brave, and absolutely essential attempt to answer the age-old question that haunts every lunch break:
> _"What should we eat?"_

This project is not just a software application.  
It's a survival tool for indecisive groups, hangry developers, and anyone who's ever said "I don't care, you choose" and then shot down every suggestion.

## 🧠 Why the name?

Because that's literally what we asked ourselves.  
Out loud.  
At least 20 times.  
Every. Single. Day.

And like true engineers, we decided:
> _If a question causes us pain, we shall automate it._

Thus, `eat-what-for-lunch` was born — not out of inspiration, but desperation (and maybe a little hunger).

## 🛠️ What does it do?

- Helps you decide what to eat for lunch
- Ends group debates (or starts new ones)
- Uses [insert your logic, randomizer, recommendation algorithm, AI, etc.]
- Guarantees that someone will still say: _“I don’t want that.”_

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Who made this?

A hungry, slightly over-caffeinated group of students who were tired of fighting over noodles vs. burgers.
